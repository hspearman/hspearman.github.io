Hi, I'm Hannah. I'm a **Software Engineer** interested in **Web Development** that lives in **Chicago, Illinois**.

I love programming so I do it for a living. But work aside, there's always a lot to learn and something you don't know.

I craft personal projects-- not only to learn something new, but to make my ideas (large or small) tangible.

Besides that, I read and write about technical topics to go beyond abstractions and see how stuff really works.

When I'm not deep in code, I like to practice guitar, bike, read, play video games, find new music, go to concerts, hunt for hobbies, and seek out adventures.
