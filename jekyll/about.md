Hi, I’m Hannah. I’m a **Software Engineer** that works in **Web Development** and lives in **Chicago, Illinois**. I love programming so I do it for a living.

Aside from work, I like to craft personal projects– not only to learn, but to make my ideas (large or small) tangible.

When I’m not deep in code, I like to practice guitar, bike, read, play video games, find new music, go to concerts, hunt for hobbies, and seek out adventures.
